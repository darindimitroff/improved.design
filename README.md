# Improved

Improved is a place where I can iterate on random ideas that go through my head, unified by the following principles.

- the improvement should make the overall interaction faster and/or easier
- the improvement should empower users
- the improvement should not take away functionality
- the improvementâ€™s UI and interaction pattern should feel as aligned with the existing system as possible
- the improvement should be executable in a real world scenario
