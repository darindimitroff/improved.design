One of my favorite apps, if not the favorite app on my phone, is Instapaper. It helps me stay on top of my day, without having to read pieces I‚Äôd otherwise totally forget about. It looks great, too. Yet, there‚Äôs one thing that keeps bugging me - the lack of –∞ way to continue reading where I left off. 

## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What‚Äôs the use case?
Most of the articles I save on Instapaper are long reads and, as I save a lot of them, they tend to stack up, creating a long, sad list of articles I‚Äôm hoping to read on day.

As I am sure most people do, I read a lot during my morning commutes, during breaks while at the office and at home. Device-wise these occasions happen in the following order: phone, desktop, phone. 

So, here‚Äôs the friction point: If I‚Äôm reading an older article on my phone, thus further down on the list, and I switch between devices, I have to find the article once again to continue where I left off on a previous device (or on the same device too).

At this point I can try using the app‚Äôs Read Progress filter, but reading progress doesn‚Äôt necessarily equal the chronological order in which I‚Äôve opened and read the articles on my list. 


## ü§î So, what‚Äôs the solution?

A collection of swipeable cards, named Currently Reading, that are pinned above the article list. I believe sideswiping is an easy to use and well-known interaction pattern. At the bottom of every card there‚Äôs a progress bar, showing me the progress in the article (more on this pattern in Darin‚Äôs post).

Although the cards have a slight Material Design feel, they‚Äôre not conflicting Instapaper‚Äôs overall design language, which was crucial. To make the feature more prominent and keep Instapaper‚Äôs main menu up to date, we could also introduce a standard menu item for Currently Reading.

I don‚Äôt know about you, but one of these surely would make my Instapaper cross-device-experience a lot smoother.
